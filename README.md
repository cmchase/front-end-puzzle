# front-end-puzzle
An evaluation for the assement of front-end skills

## Some Notes
The dummy data provided wasn't long enough to test some of the requirements, so I duplicated it a few times. You can toggle more/less with the button above.

The requirements didn't include details for dismissing the overlay or how to handle keyboard navigation when at the top/bottom of the filtered lists, so I used my best judgement.
