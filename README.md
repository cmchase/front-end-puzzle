# Front-End Puzzle
An evaluation for the assessment of front-end skills

## Some Notes
The dummy data provided wasn't long enough to test some of the requirements, so I duplicated it a few times. You can toggle more/less with the button above.

The requirements didn't include details for dismissing the overlay, how to handle keyboard navigation when at the top/bottom of the workspace list, or empty data states, so I used my best judgement for an intuitive experience.

The requirements also didn't specifiy element sizes, typography or iconography, so I used some guesswork and didn't sweat those details.
